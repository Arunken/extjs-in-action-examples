To run the serverside php + mysql example code in this chapter you need php5 and mysql support.


Installing the software
-----------------------

ubuntu linux:
sudo apt-get install php5-mysqlnd php5-json

centos linux:
sudo yum install httpd mysql-server php

Mac osx:
use homebrew (further instructions at http://brew.sh )

Windows:
Use the installers available from php.net and mysql.com


Mysql database setup
--------------------

The example file crud.php assumes that you have a database called "extjsinaction" accessible as user root with no pasword. Feel free to change this to your liking.

You can find further instructions on user account management in section 6.3 in the mysql manual (available here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/user-account-management.html )

Here is an example to load data.sql and grant access to the user
"extjsinaction" from the mysql admin client:

\. data.sql
grant all on extjsinaction.* to extjsinaction@localhost identified by 'extjsinaction'

you could then tweak the top line in crud.php to :
mysql_connect("localhost", "extjsinaction", "extjsinaction") or die ("could not connect:" . mysql_error());





Tweaking the datastores to run locally
--------------------------------------

In 7.5_The_Employee_Store.html you can tweak urlRoot to match your local crud.php installation.  Just remove "http://extjsinaction.com/" from urlRoot and you should pickup you local file. Remember to alter the proxy type from "jsonp" to "ajax" now that you are running locally. Now you should be able to experiment with datastores from your console in your browser.
